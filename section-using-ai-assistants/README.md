# Crossmint Docs MCP Server - Proposal

This proposal aims to add the option to connect the official Crossmint documentation through an MCP Server. Since the documentation is generated with **Mintlify**, it already includes a built-in MCP server, although there is currently no guidance on how to use it. This approach is a more efficient alternative to the `llms.txt` file.
